what is difference between waterfall and agile 

Waterfall Model	Agile Model
waterfall -Sequential — project moves step by step (requirement → design → development → testing → deployment).	
agile - Iterative and incremental — project is divided into small parts (sprints).

what is devops 

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.

devops lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle includes 7 key stages:

Plan – Define project goals, requirements, and tasks.

Code – Write the application code.

Build – Compile and build the code into deployable (artifacts).

Test – Perform automated testing to ensure quality.

Release – Deploy the code to production env or to public.

Deploy – Deliver updates continuously or automatically.

Monitoring – Manage performance, fix issues, and monitor feedback.


devops principles/phases 

Continuous Integration (CI) – Merge code changes frequently.

Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeps the code ready for deployment after testing.

CD (Continuous Deployment) - Automatically deploys every tested change to production.

Continuous Monitoring – Track performance and user experience.

Feedback & Improvement – Use feedback loops to improve future releases.

what is scrum 

Scrum is a framework used in Agile methodology for managing and completing complex projects.

Key Concepts:

Sprint: A short, fixed period (usually 2–4 weeks) where a small set of work is completed.

Scrum Team Roles:

Product Owner: Defines what needs to be built (requirements).

Scrum Master: Ensures the team follows Scrum practices.

Development Team: Builds and delivers the product.


Goal: Deliver a working product increment at the end of each sprint.
